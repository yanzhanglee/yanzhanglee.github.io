<h1 id="brief">Brief</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>This article illustrates the design process and reflection on TECHIN 521 Design Thinking Studio at GIX. This is a 10-week project and we are group in 3. The project aims to practice our design thinking and methods to generate a solution to a design question related to COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19, the whole project is remotely done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-Project%20Overview.png" alt="Project Overview" /></p>

<p><strong>My role</strong> includes brainstorming, investigation, survey and data analysis, sketches, solution proposal, prototype making and presentation. As a design background student, I also share my much of my design experience and methods with my teammates.</p>

<p>This article would be divided into 4 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#01-problem-definition-&amp;-user-research">Problem Definition &amp; User Research</a></li>
  <li><a href="#02-solution-proposal">Solution Proposal</a></li>
  <li><a href="#03-solution-iteration">Solution Iteration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#04-takeaways">Takeaways</a></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="01-problem-definition--user-research">01 Problem Definition &amp; User Research</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The input of this phase includes field investigation, survey and data analysis, secondary research, brainstomring, etc. Interview is not included. The outcome of this phase is a refined design question, a list of design insights and a list of prioritized user requirements. The overall design report can be referred <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDBkFaKwo17pn6VsFLtlIg78skFmTX3WTr2of2HUUTA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="11-initial-design-question--research">1.1 Initial Design Question &amp; Research</h2>
<p>The initial design question is:<br />
<strong>How can we facilitate employees who are working in the office to wear masks when it is necessary?</strong></p>

<p>To be specific, in China, most of the employees have come back to the office and began to work on-site for several months. People are becoming less vigilant to COVID and more and more people began to take their masks off in a relatively ‘safe’ place like their office. However, in-person communication without wearing a mask is still at high risk of infection. Thus, we are focusing on the employee’s perspective, trying to figure out how they use masks, why they wear or do not wear a mask, and what kind of design can we do to help them to keep safe in the workplace.</p>

<p>The supporting evidence from secondary research includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People in China are becoming less vigilant to COVID. The Mask Use Rate dropped from over 72% (May, 2020) to 59% (Oct, 2020).</li>
  <li>More than 90% of the companies were back to on-site working in March, 2020.</li>
  <li>In-person communication is at high risk of infection.</li>
  <li>Ventilation and mask use can greatly help to protect from COVID in the office environment.</li>
  <li>About half of people think masks are uncomfortable to wear. Other reasons include hard to remember to re-wear masks, inefficient communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="12-stakeholders--core-users">1.2 Stakeholders &amp; Core Users</h2>
<p><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-Stakeholders.png.001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our core users will be white-collars who have returned to the company and have been working on-site for months. They have stable daily routines and familiar working environments, which makes it easy for them to ignore the risk of being infected. Many of them have taken off masks during their work.
To be specific, our target users would be employees who 1) do not wear masks during in-person communication and 2) would have in-person communication usually.</p>

<p>2 Key factors to group users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The frequency of in-person communication is high or low. ‘High’ stands for more than 1 meeting/day, the portion is 20% (according to survey).</li>
  <li>The reasons why they did not wear a mask during in-person communication. One reason is that they trust in people or colleagues so they think it is unnecessary. The other reason is that they think it is necessary to wear masks while they forget to wear/bring or it is uncomfortable or inefficient.</li>
</ul>

<p>The users are divided into 3 segments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target Segment 1: Employees who would have frequent in-person communication with other employees. According to the survey, around 20% of the samples would have more than 1 meeting/day.</li>
  <li>Target Segment 2: Employees who do not wear masks because they think it is unnecessary.</li>
  <li>Target Segment 3: Employees who do not wear masks because they forget to wear/bring the masks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="13-field-research--survey-data-analysis">1.3 Field Research &amp; Survey Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Through semi-structural field observation, taking notes, we proved the phenomena and generated a list of findings.</p>

<p>Later, survey was conducted to learn more on the user behaviors and why they behave like this. We received 108 responses, and the valid number is 97 after filtering. 58 respondents consisted of our connections and their colleagues, the other 50 people were recruited from an online recruitment service.</p>

<p>Comparison analysis, correlation analysis are included in survey data analysis. Interesting findings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>55.7% of the samples believe that it is safe to talk with colleagues without a mask. 40.2% of samples think it is safe to talk face-to face without a mask. Trust affects employees’ not wearing masks during communication.</li>
  <li>34% of the samples consider ‘forget to take on masks’ a reason for in-person communication without masks.</li>
  <li>46.4% of samples think it is inconvenient and inefficient to communicate when wearing a mask.</li>
  <li>When an employee takes COVID infection risk more seriously, he or she would probably wear a mask more usually when sitting in its own workplace, chatting and meeting with others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please find more details in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDBkFaKwo17pn6VsFLtlIg78skFmTX3WTr2of2HUUTA/edit?usp=sharing">report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="15-insights--design-requirements">1.5 Insights &amp; Design Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="insights">Insights</h3>
<p>Affinity analysis is conducted during the discussion to generate insights.
<img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-My%20First%20Board.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Our target users (white-collar employees) are at a high level of risk of infection.</li>
  <li>Chatting casually with colleagues is the most frequent in-person communication.</li>
  <li>People expect that meetings should be efficient, not interrupted.</li>
  <li>People caring about COVID infection risk more would probably wear a mask.</li>
  <li>People may ignore some protective guidelines.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why user does not wear a mask</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>People may take off masks because of inconvenience and discomfort.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to take on the mask is a reason for in-person communication without masks.</li>
  <li>When chatting casually, people are not likely to wear masks due to trust in the environment and colleagues.</li>
  <li>People may not wear a mask during meetings because it is not efficient.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prioritized-design-requirements">Prioritized Design Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The solution should help reduce employees’ risk of being infected by COVID-19 when they are working on-site</li>
  <li>The solution should promote an atmosphere and remind users to take measures to keep safe</li>
  <li>The design must be compatible with the existing company system and policy</li>
  <li>The solution must be affordable for the company</li>
  <li>The design can only use existing materials and technologies that have been proved effective to prevent COVID infection</li>
  <li>The solution should ensure face-to-face communication as well as efficiency in meetings and discussions</li>
  <li>To achieve a relatively high use rate, the solution must encourage people to follow</li>
  <li>The solution should apply to different casual chatting scenarios.</li>
  <li>The solution should help users understand the potential risk of infection and their exposure level to potential viruses</li>
  <li>The solution should relieve the discomfort of wearing a mask</li>
  <li>The solution must be easy to use and not change the user’s daily routine dramatically</li>
  <li>The solution should give users reminders in a calm manner and should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms</li>
  <li>The solution should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms</li>
  <li>The solution should cater for different kinds of offices</li>
  <li>The solution should make use of common facilities in the company to avoid extra purchasing expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of this phase, the design question is refiend to be:<br />
<strong>How can we remind and encourage employees to take measures to protect themselves from COVID-19 during in-person communications?</strong></p>

<h1 id="02-solution-proposal">02 Solution Proposal</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this phase, based on what we got from previous analysis, we brainstormed and proposed design solution. We are required to think of the solution in a scenario - through sketches and discussion. The detail report can be referred <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAMnYGPFkKkd6ZDmUmyCg1zh4TprBw7yJnaFLVBORx0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="21-scenarios">2.1 Scenarios</h2>
<p>Through sketches, we generated 3 scenarios where our solution could possibly involve.
<img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-Scenario.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main scenarios are: Office entrance / elevators, Meeting rooms, Cafeteria / vending machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-scenario_new.png" width="100%" /></p>

<h2 id="22-initial-solution">2.2 Initial Solution</h2>

<p>To summarize, our initial solution is combined by 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Face-mask identification or payment built on real-life terminals. By making a mask a part of identification or payment, mask will be too important to be forgotten.</li>
  <li>Pop-up reminders based on your schedules or your behaviors</li>
  <li>A reward credits system based on Hook Model to encourage users to earn credits and form habits.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-scenario_new2.png" width="60%" /><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-initial%20solution.png" width="40%" /></p>

<p><strong>What is the Hook Model?</strong><br />
It is how the solution educate and change user behaviors.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-Hook.png" width="100%" /></p>

<h1 id="03-solution-iteration">03 Solution Iteration</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Through usability test on core tasks, we figured out what needs to be improved. The detailed report can be referred <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypW4Oaat566G3dP3ljK-k5RCtK8CdMs5dDWjcgIb3Oo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="31-usability-test">3.1 Usability Test</h2>
<p>In this study, we presented prototypes of 4 digital interfaces created with Modao and an interactive website as a prototype of the terminal interface. The participants received a separate link for each task. One of the team members was the narrative and another one was the note taker.
Each of the prototypes are interactive so team members did not need to operate them and users can explore on their own. Task descriptions and TODOs are presented by slides via Zoom. The testing process was recorded by Zoom.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14PXMmmxwUyORfflrhIfWTK6ca6UOSR83cRBd6QHDfQE/edit#slide=id.gad56317de3_0_21">Link to the test introduction slides</a>.</p>

<p>Link to tasks</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://modao.cc/app/99209f49e85a954d812644de00e5c6bf844d41b3?simulator_type=device&amp;sticky">Task 1</a>. The meeting reminder.</li>
  <li><a href="https://modao.cc/app/d0579e7a09c165032b048020fd71e5a394cdf81c?simulator_type=device&amp;sticky">Task 2</a>. The lunch reminder.</li>
  <li><a href="https://maskmantask3.azurewebsites.net/Other.html">Task 3</a>. Face-mask recognition module on cashier.</li>
  <li><a href="https://modao.cc/app/5eda36078d9fe1b03b8f75be368e9bfe3ffd294b?simulator_type=device&amp;sticky">Task 4</a>. The check-out reminder.</li>
  <li><a href="https://modao.cc/app/4e1a47c97977016891793dc4df60de0229a5ac36?simulator_type=device&amp;sticky">Task 5</a>. The summary and reward system.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the feedback from the usability test, we improved our design.</p>

<h2 id="32-final-solution">3.2 Final Solution</h2>

<p>The final solution is an integrated system, which includes front-end terminals and backend parts. The system is illustrated below.
<img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-System%20Overview.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From user perspective, they would notice 2 kinds of things.</p>

<p>First, a Mini Program or bot in their working IM Application. This us to send them reminder of related protective measures, and let user confirm their credits as well as rewards.</p>

<p>Second, display screens in meeting rooms and payment/entry recognition machines would also be integrated into the system. They would be used to detect user whether they are wearing a mask or not.
<img src="https://img.oh-eureka.com/pics/2020-12-13-User%20perspective.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Based on the usability test, 2 main changes are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A Leaderboard which encourages user to have good behavior and let other colleagues to check so as to reduce cheating.</li>
  <li>More attractive rewards.</li>
</ol>
