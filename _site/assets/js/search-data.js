        "excerpt":"Safe Office - An intelligent helper system to keep your office safe and your employees healthy. Brief   This article illustrates the design process and reflection on TECHIN 521 Design Thinking Studio at GIX. This is a 10-week project and we are group in 3. The project aims to practice our design thinking and methods to generate a solution to a design question related to COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19, the whole project is remotely done.  My role includes brainstorming, investigation, survey and data analysis, sketches, solution proposal, prototype making and presentation. As a design background student, I also share my much of my design experience and methods with my teammates. This article would be divided into 4 parts:   Problem Definition &amp; User Research  Solution Proposal  Solution Iteration  Takeaways 01 Problem Definition &amp; User Research   The input of this phase includes field investigation, survey and data analysis, secondary research, brainstomring, etc. Interview is not included. The outcome of this phase is a refined design question, a list of design insights and a list of prioritized user requirements. The overall design report can be referred here. 1.1 Initial Design Question &amp; Research The initial design question is:How can we facilitate employees who are working in the office to wear masks when it is necessary? To be specific, in China, most of the employees have come back to the office and began to work on-site for several months. People are becoming less vigilant to COVID and more and more people began to take their masks off in a relatively ‘safe’ place like their office. However, in-person communication without wearing a mask is still at high risk of infection. Thus, we are focusing on the employee’s perspective, trying to figure out how they use masks, why they wear or do not wear a mask, and what kind of design can we do to help them to keep safe in the workplace. The supporting evidence from secondary research includes:   People in China are becoming less vigilant to COVID. The Mask Use Rate dropped from over 72% (May, 2020) to 59% (Oct, 2020).  More than 90% of the companies were back to on-site working in March, 2020.  In-person communication is at high risk of infection.  Ventilation and mask use can greatly help to protect from COVID in the office environment.  About half of people think masks are uncomfortable to wear. Other reasons include hard to remember to re-wear masks, inefficient communication.1.2 Stakeholders &amp; Core Users  Our core users will be white-collars who have returned to the company and have been working on-site for months. They have stable daily routines and familiar working environments, which makes it easy for them to ignore the risk of being infected. Many of them have taken off masks during their work.To be specific, our target users would be employees who 1) do not wear masks during in-person communication and 2) would have in-person communication usually. 2 Key factors to group users:   The frequency of in-person communication is high or low. ‘High’ stands for more than 1 meeting/day, the portion is 20% (according to survey).  The reasons why they did not wear a mask during in-person communication. One reason is that they trust in people or colleagues so they think it is unnecessary. The other reason is that they think it is necessary to wear masks while they forget to wear/bring or it is uncomfortable or inefficient.The users are divided into 3 segments.   Target Segment 1: Employees who would have frequent in-person communication with other employees. According to the survey, around 20% of the samples would have more than 1 meeting/day.  Target Segment 2: Employees who do not wear masks because they think it is unnecessary.  Target Segment 3: Employees who do not wear masks because they forget to wear/bring the masks.1.3 Field Research &amp; Survey Data Analysis Through semi-structural field observation, taking notes, we proved the phenomena and generated a list of findings. Later, survey was conducted to learn more on the user behaviors and why they behave like this. We received 108 responses, and the valid number is 97 after filtering. 58 respondents consisted of our connections and their colleagues, the other 50 people were recruited from an online recruitment service. Comparison analysis, correlation analysis are included in survey data analysis. Interesting findings include:   55.7% of the samples believe that it is safe to talk with colleagues without a mask. 40.2% of samples think it is safe to talk face-to face without a mask. Trust affects employees’ not wearing masks during communication.  34% of the samples consider ‘forget to take on masks’ a reason for in-person communication without masks.  46.4% of samples think it is inconvenient and inefficient to communicate when wearing a mask.  When an employee takes COVID infection risk more seriously, he or she would probably wear a mask more usually when sitting in its own workplace, chatting and meeting with others.Please find more details in the report. 1.5 Insights &amp; Design Requirements Insights Affinity analysis is conducted during the discussion to generate insights. User Experience   Our target users (white-collar employees) are at a high level of risk of infection.  Chatting casually with colleagues is the most frequent in-person communication.  People expect that meetings should be efficient, not interrupted.  People caring about COVID infection risk more would probably wear a mask.  People may ignore some protective guidelines.Why user does not wear a mask   People may take off masks because of inconvenience and discomfort.  Forgetting to take on the mask is a reason for in-person communication without masks.  When chatting casually, people are not likely to wear masks due to trust in the environment and colleagues.  People may not wear a mask during meetings because it is not efficient.Prioritized Design Requirements   The solution should help reduce employees’ risk of being infected by COVID-19 when they are working on-site  The solution should promote an atmosphere and remind users to take measures to keep safe  The design must be compatible with the existing company system and policy  The solution must be affordable for the company  The design can only use existing materials and technologies that have been proved effective to prevent COVID infection  The solution should ensure face-to-face communication as well as efficiency in meetings and discussions  To achieve a relatively high use rate, the solution must encourage people to follow  The solution should apply to different casual chatting scenarios.  The solution should help users understand the potential risk of infection and their exposure level to potential viruses  The solution should relieve the discomfort of wearing a mask  The solution must be easy to use and not change the user’s daily routine dramatically  The solution should give users reminders in a calm manner and should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms  The solution should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms  The solution should cater for different kinds of offices  The solution should make use of common facilities in the company to avoid extra purchasing expenditureAt the end of this phase, the design question is refiend to be:How can we remind and encourage employees to take measures to protect themselves from COVID-19 during in-person communications? 02 Solution Proposal   In this phase, based on what we got from previous analysis, we brainstormed and proposed design solution. We are required to think of the solution in a scenario - through sketches and discussion. The detail report can be referred here. 2.1 Scenarios Through sketches, we generated 3 scenarios where our solution could possibly involve. The main scenarios are: Office entrance / elevators, Meeting rooms, Cafeteria / vending machine.  2.2 Initial Solution To summarize, our initial solution is combined by 3 parts:   Face-mask identification or payment built on real-life terminals. By making a mask a part of identification or payment, mask will be too important to be forgotten.  Pop-up reminders based on your schedules or your behaviors  A reward credits system based on Hook Model to encourage users to earn credits and form habits. What is the Hook Model?It is how the solution educate and change user behaviors.  03 Solution Iteration   Through usability test on core tasks, we figured out what needs to be improved. The detailed report can be referred here. 3.1 Usability Test In this study, we presented prototypes of 4 digital interfaces created with Modao and an interactive website as a prototype of the terminal interface. The participants received a separate link for each task. One of the team members was the narrative and another one was the note taker.Each of the prototypes are interactive so team members did not need to operate them and users can explore on their own. Task descriptions and TODOs are presented by slides via Zoom. The testing process was recorded by Zoom. Link to the test introduction slides. Link to tasks   Task 1. The meeting reminder.  Task 2. The lunch reminder.  Task 3. Face-mask recognition module on cashier.  Task 4. The check-out reminder.  Task 5. The summary and reward system.According to the feedback from the usability test, we improved our design. 3.2 Final Solution The final solution is an integrated system, which includes front-end terminals and backend parts. The system is illustrated below. From user perspective, they would notice 2 kinds of things. First, a Mini Program or bot in their working IM Application. This us to send them reminder of related protective measures, and let user confirm their credits as well as rewards. Second, display screens in meeting rooms and payment/entry recognition machines would also be integrated into the system. They would be used to detect user whether they are wearing a mask or not. Based on the usability test, 2 main changes are:   A Leaderboard which encourages user to have good behavior and let other colleagues to check so as to reduce cheating.  More attractive rewards. 04 Takeaways 4.1 Methods 4.1.1 About Defining Question Scoping question is the most important and critical job to start a design or research process. Questions are everywhere, but good questions are unique and precious. From my perspective, the scope of the question is the primary issue to determine a question to be good or bad. In this design process, we spent nearly a month on scoping question to make the subject and goal more precise. The question can be divided into: Subject(WHO) + Goal(WHAT) + WHEN(optional) + WHERE(optional).  The Goal is changed from ‘wearing masks’ to ‘stay safe’, actually the scope is larger after we collect more information. And we removed words like ‘when it is necessary’ which are too vague and meaningless. I find it really inspired when I reflect on how and why we change the design question, it is like I am reflecting the whole research process. What’s more, we are required to ‘never draw a conclusion too fast’, and this is a really efficient method to prevent us from stopping information collection, and to come out with a more precious design question. 4.1.2 About Survey &amp; Data Analysis As a quantitative method, survey can be used to test hypothesis, get more evidence and find new insights. But the primary use is still testing hypothesis. In this design process, the survey and data analysis teaches me about 2 things:   What we observed in field research might be not representative. The observation of white-collar employee behaviors reveals that most of them usually remove their mask as soon as they arrive at their cubicles, and they would not wear masks during in-person communications. But the survey result shows that only half of employees would not wear mask.  Clear hypothesis could help to generate better questionnaire. When we did the survey data analysis, we actually figured out that we missed several questions to ask, and that is because we are not sure about the hypothesis we would like to test by the survey. If we have a clear hypothesis before we make the questionnaire, the methods may work better.4.1.3 About Multidisciplinary Collaboration The collaboration did not run smoothly, since all members are participating and collaborating online, and we have different background. We would often have different ideas on design solution and insights - sometimes we would have conflicting ideas on the same issue. At this stage, the thing we would do is not voting, but discussing and persuading with others. We believe that voting is not a good way to solve conflict, and through persuading and discussing, we can flatten our knowledge and understanding. Multidisciplinary collaboration strengthens the conflict while brings some benefits - the different background causes knowledge gap between us, and this gap would sometimes be inspiring. When designing the solution, I would sometimes propose a solution, but teammates disagree on this proposal. My solution would be firstly understand why they disagree on this, then convey all the information I have, and to persuade them. This process would happen on them too, and it brings deeper communication and more inspiration. 4.2 Thinking 4.2.1 About Design Thinking Process Before the course, we are more likely to divide the goal into several steps and try to realize it. I think this is good, but it is not working in design. Design is to solve wicked problems, which means there is usually more than one solution or even no solution. So, we have to think in an iterated and systematic way, to define the problem and develop the solution and even iterate for several times, and finally have a relatively better answer to the wicked problem.  4.2.2 What is a good design solution Another reflection is about how do we determine a design solution to be good or not. In TA’s review of our usability test report, the design of the leaderboard is doubted. The leaderboard is proposed by a participants in usability test, and reviewed and further designed by us. It is a leaderboard of the credits, where users can see themselves and other colleagues on the board. By implementing this, we would like the board to be an trigger and push users to earn more credits, and the existing of the board allow colleagues to supervise each other, since the increasing of credits should be followed with correspondent behaviors, which is visible to others. The result would be pushed to users through the IM App at the end of the day. Our team appreciate the design, and this idea is really similar to an existing design of Wechat, which is a leaderboard of how many steps each user walks. The problems TA mentioned: 1. People may ignore the board, 2. It may cause more cheating, have their possibilities and reasons. The example of this shows that a good design in our mind would not always be a good design to others. However, what is the criteria? From my previous design experience, I would like to let users to be the judge - developing a MVP, setting data indicator, launching an A/B test and let users and data to give us answer. 4.3 Conclusion This course provides me a precious experience to learn more on design thinking and methods. I would appreciate the learning and making process, and put all I learned into my future career. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"A website which could evaluate the potential value of a patent.一个可以衡量专利潜在价值的网站    The website is now available. View website    Code Resource  I did this design project during my outbound exchange period in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), with the guide of Prof.Luo Jianxi. Generally speaking, I redesigned the structure of the website as well as the visual part, and put the design into practice by building the website based on my design. Please forgive me for the low quality of some parts of the website, because of my naive design experience and poor deleloping skill. 这是我在新加坡科技设计大学（SUTD）交换时的科研项目，指导教授为Luo Jianxi教授。总体上看，我基于用户体验重新设计了网站的结构与视觉，并使用自己的前端开发技能付诸实践。该网站现已上线，可以在下方的链接中尝试使用或者是获得源码。必须承认，囿于开发水平和设计经验，网站中有太多不成熟和不够细致的地方，请见谅。 Schema 大纲 Understand the theory 理解原理Design 设计Develop 开发Improvement 用户调研、反馈与迭代Shortcoming &amp; Take Away 缺点与学习 Understand the theory 理解原理 这个网站旨在使用一种新型独特的测量方式来测量一个专利的潜在价值。这个测量方式是由SUTD-MIT国际设计中心（IDC）的Luo Jianxi教授与He Yuejun博士研究发现的，相关论文如下：   Yuejun He, Jianxi Luo (2017) The Novelty “Sweet Spot” of Invention. Design Science, 3, e21.  Yuejun He, Jianxi Luo (2018) Assess Novelty of An Invention Using the Central-Extreme Novelty Matrix: A Case Study of Juvo Lab’s Fibre-Optic Sensor Mat. ICDC, 2018, Bath, UK.专利刚被申请时，很难在短期内判断其商业价值，一般来说都需要10年以上的时间才能得到确认。研究发现的这种新型方法指出，使用文中所述的两个变量——专利新颖程度的“极值”与“中心值”——进行专利“坐标”的标定，专利价值的分布有规律可循，其中有价值专利密度最高的区域被称之为“Sweet Spot”。原始的网站如下图所示，图中的矩阵使用蓝色边框将“Sweet Spot”区域框出。用户输入专利的ID或者是关键词，再对对应的专利进行查询，它在矩阵中的位置会对应高亮。如果它位于蓝色区域中，那么它的潜在价值可能是较大的。 在阅读文献的过程中，我发现实际上论文中已经给出了一张完整的专利潜在价值分布图。所谓的“Sweet Spot”只是其中最集中的一块区域，但其周边的深色区域较浅色区域，专利的潜在价值依然较大。那么为什么不直接将专利的对应分布直接地告诉用户呢？否则，对用户来说，专利便只有“在区域内”和“在区域外”两种情况。经过和教授讨论，这样的方式是可行的。于是接着进入了设计阶段。 Design 设计 建立在对论文和评估方法有一定了解的基础上，我的设计步骤如下：   分析原网站用户交互流程  设计用户交互流程  设计网站框架  制作视觉稿Analyze Original Website 分析原网站用户交互流程 根据对原网站的体验，我将用户交互流程制作如下图：可以发现，用户在使用的过程中会产生诸如：什么是专利的新颖性？网站是怎么衡量它的？专利的ID是什么？专利的关键词是什么？等问题。 Design User Interaction 设计用户交互流程 该网站的本质是一个工具，其核心在于提供专利价值的衡量。对于一个工具，可以暂时简单地把用户分为小白用户(Naive User)与熟练用户(Skillful User)两类。针对熟练用户，网站需要做到快速响应，让用户的操作流畅而完整；针对小白用户，则需要首先解答“网站是做什么的？”这个问题，同时教育用户并建立信任感。对此，我计划使用一个Demo进行案例教学，并提供How it works这个部分进行评估原理的简单讲解。新的用户交互流程如下： Design Web Structure 设计网站框架 结合用户交互流程，网站框架如下：   Home 主页          Search Patent ID 搜索专利ID      Search Keywords 搜索关键词        Demo 案例          Select a Patent 选择专利      View Result 查看结果        How it works 原理  About 关于Visual Design 制作视觉稿 随后，我使用Ai制作了网页的视觉稿，并结合教授的意见进行了反复修改。在制作视觉稿的过程中，我结合自学的前端知识，尽量避免了“做不出来的设计”。（当然，更多是由于我自身技术能力的不足） Develop 开发 除去导航栏等小部件，我将需求分为了以下几个主要部分，并按顺序进行开发： Demo 当用户的Cookie判断为第一次浏览该页面时，进入Demo页面。Demo页面希望呈现出三个专利供用户选择。这三个专利需要满足一些条件，比如专利本身或者专利对应的产品要有足够的知名度，同时专利自身在测量矩阵上的分布要在高价值区域。希望通过这样的方式，让用户测试一个专利，并获取相应的信息，在教学的同时建立测量机制的可信度。在花费了大量的时间之后，我选择了比较合适的三个专利。对专利视觉信息的呈现也做了一定的组织安排。在实现方面，基本是通过css来实现的。为了让网页显得更加具有焦点和富有科技感，我引用了particle.js，在网页的背景制作了可与鼠标交互的粒子动效。选择其中一个专利进行测量之后，详情页面会介绍测量的结果。除去专利本身的信息外，也会呈现该专利与现实世界中具体产品应用的关系。通过这个页面，希望让用户明白网站中矩阵坐标、对应颜色与产品潜在价值的映射关系，同时建立对这样的评价体系的信任。 Home 主页提供输入专利ID或者关键词进行搜索的功能，显示界面应该包括左侧的矩阵位置和右侧的专利信息。在原版的基础上，我做了如下的优化：   将Keywords和ID的输入框进行微调  将原本不具有强度的矩阵转换为现在具有强度的矩阵，通过颜色表示价值高低  将专利信息的呈现进行调整 How it works How it works页面的本意是通过一个页面介绍论文中用于衡量专利价值的方法。由于对信息的理解和表达能力的限制，这个页面的完成度并不高，故在此处就不展示了，有兴趣可以前往http://www.innogps.com/innovelty/how_it_works.html 查看。 Improvement 用户调研、反馈与迭代 第一版的网站并非是如前文图示那样的。在信息呈现方式上与现在的版本有着较大的差距，遗憾的是我没有保存网页的前一版本。具体来说，做了如下的改变：   将原版本中的Demo中三个专利的布局和呈现方式做了改变  将Demo中专利详情页的布局和呈现做了改变  调整了Home中Keywords搜索的呈现方式这些改变是建立在我将网页发给2位设计专业的同学和2位外专业的朋友的反馈的基础上的，根据他们对网站意图和视觉呈现的评价，我做出了相应的改变。 Shortcoming &amp; Take Away 缺点与学习 最大的不足之一是由于自学前端经验不足，所有页面没有使用开发框架，所以没有做移动端适配，在小尺寸的屏幕上会出现形变。此外，由于前端实践的时间与精力需求对于我来说远高于设计的，在设计方面有很多细节没有做到位。相对的，第一次独立完成了网页的设计与开发，在很多细节上有了自己的认知与把控，并确立了继续学习React等开发框架的计划。 ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"It encourages users to share anything and let other users praise for it. 夸夸小程序是一个用户分享内容，其他用户只能发表夸赞评论的社区 Overview Brief Introduction Based on a culture phenomena (explained in 01 Background), me and 3 teammates tried to make it a product and make profits from it. We got involved in the culture phenomena, trying to control it and make it our promotion media in the future, which was quite successful. Also, we quickly designed and developed the Wechat Mini Program and successful made profits from it. Through this project, we successfully applied for a National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training For College Students. We finally gave up the program but learned a lot from the experience. But you can still try it by searching “夸夸” in Wechat. Highlights   The product design opportunity is quite different from usual products, it comes from a culture phenomena and we tried to make it a product.  Design to encourage users to share and comment easily, and make them feel inspired.  Design to make profits from ad and user services.Information Mar. 2019 - Apr. 2019 | 1 month | 4 people My Role   As product manager, planned the product functions, discussed with developer on feasibility problem and planned the schedule.  As UX and UI designer, designed the user interaction and user interfaces, drafted the sketch and put into development.  Directed the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training For College Students, planned for more projects with teammates.Schema 01 Background02 Design Goals03 Design Challenges04 Develop Plan05 Design06 Launch and Iteration07 Conclusion 01 Background Wechat(微信): The biggest IM App in China. Wechat Mini Program: Apps which can be used within Wechat and do not need to be downloaded and installed on the system. Moment(朋友圈): A function of Wechat, where users share their thoughts by publishing photos or text. During the mid-Feb. in 2019, posts about ‘ZJU KuaKua Wechat group’ are filled with ZJUer’s moments. Those posts are all about the interesting conversation that happened in KuaKua Wechat group, which makes people laugh or feel inspired. ZJU KuaKua Wechat group originates from another group in Douban (a website and app community of sharing interests), the rule is that any member can share anything in the group especially the upset things, and other members can only comment or reply with praise. For example, when a user sent “I broke up today…”, the other users can comment like “OMG, you are free now! You deserve someone better and surely you can find a true love. Sounds great!” Because of the funny and inspiring conversation, the Wechat KuaKua group soon became very popular and the groups are more and more. Within 3 days, there are more than 1500 people in the KuaKua Wechat Group in ZJU, and other universities are building up the groups as well. Our team got involved in the first KuaKua group when it set up. After experienced the rule, we considered it a workable concept which can be transferred into a product. Mini Program has 2 advantages comparing to Wechat groups, including a wider range community and less operation consumption. Thus, we tried to develop the KuaKua Wechat Mini Program. 02 Design Goals Firstly, we analyzed the product goals:   To accumulate users, increase DAU.  To encourage users to spread and share the Mini Program.  To make profits through ad or paid service.Then, we clarify the design goals:   To let users easily use the Mini Program and have a better experience than Wechat groups.  To make users share or spread the Mini Program to increase DAU.03 Design Challenges To be specific and based on the team capability, I clarify the design challenges:   A warm and welcomed interface which creates the atmosphere of praise and inspiration.

Based on the feedback, we changed our design and develop direction. 05 Design I delivered the first version of UI in 3 days, constructing the basic functions. I would show the user-flow and demonstrate design details. Adopted the most similar way to publish posts as in a Wechat group. Users can finish all the operation at the bottom of the phone.Users can use ‘red envelope’ to reward users who comment him or her with praise. This model is similar to the Red Envelope function in Wechat, so it would be easy for users to learn. Users can also praise other’s posts. Meanwhile, your posts may be rewarded by others as long as it is interesting or inspiring. Other unimportant pages are not shown. I deliver about 30 interfaces to develop in 3 days. Waiting for the data to make iteration. 06 Launch and Iteration After developed the Mini Program, we send it to several KuaKua Wechat group to collect feedback and data.We monitored the users’ behavior and tried to figure out how to improve the Mini Program. We also collected feedback from advanced users. From the data we learned that, users are not likely to share their posts directly in their moments. And even we did not do any promotion, users are growing but hard to reserve. We did several improvement and fix several bugs. More importantly, we adopted chat-bot to Mini Program, so user’s posts will always have comments. The bot is not that intelligent but it is working. Besides, we thought the current Mini Program is like a forum, where everything goes really slow. Users did not have the feeling that the comments and praise will be as fast as they are in a Wechat group. Even though users can view more various posts and praise, they still want the instant message feeling. Therefore, we decided to make a revolutionary improvement.The new Mini Program will be like chatting rooms, just like Wechat groups. But the chatting rooms will be created and destroyed shortly, making the comments rapid and interesting. The new version is shown below. But due to limited effort, we did not develop this version. 07 Conclusion Comparing to ordinary App project, this project is different because:   It is designed for build and launch.  Gain profits from it.It still exists user needs and design definition progress, but it needs a really fast developing since we need to catch the hot spot. It is my first time really design for build and launch. What’s more, we did earn money from building the App, even it is not too much, but at least it means some one appreciates our work.

        "excerpt":"an App and service design to improve micro-district community atmosphere. 有缘共邻里，何不来相聚   如果你使用的是MacOS，可以直接下载可交互原型进行体验. Overview Brief Introduction 邻聚(Lin-ju),邻 stands for neighbors and 聚 stands for reunion, so name it Neighbor-Reunion in English. This design comes from the User Experience Design Award, where we did users and business research, brainstorm, interaction design, visual design, shooting and making videos to deliver our ideas. From the preliminary\tcontest, intermediary contest and final contest, we finally won the National 3rd Prize, ranking top 20 out of 500+ teams. Based on our research, we try to use design to improve the community atmosphere, encouraging tenements to communicate and making the best use of resources from tenements, residential property management company and surrounding stores. Highlights   A very completed research and design process.  Interesting new experience and interaction by adopting advanced technology.Information Mar. 2019 - Jul. 2019 | 4 months | 7 people My Role   As team leader, schedule and manage the design process, including meetings, allocating work, making decisions or so.  As User Experience Designer, offered valuable suggestions and ideas to functions and interactions. Delivered more than 50 interaction interfaces.Schema 01 Background   User perspective: In modern cities, residents live in micro-districts or communities, spending their nights and weekends at their house. However, there are reports pointing out that neighbors are being more and more unfamiliar with each other. Residents tend to stay in their houses, but many of them actually have a desire to make friends. Also, new members of the community need opportunities to fit in. Meanwhile, there are activities in communities or micro-districts, but the types are limited and management is terrible.  Technical perspective: Existing products has experience problems, since they do not connect well with the residential property management company and do not well-operated. Since residents live in a community, they must have something in common like salary, taste or work. With those similarity, it would be easier for them to make friends.  Market perspective: There are idle resources around the community, like community space or surrounding cafe, stores. Those resources can be used better.02 Research 2.1 Competing Products Analysis We collected more than 10 related Apps on App Store, analyzed them from many dimensions. The result is:   Those Apps are lack of cooperation with stakeholders, functions are single or unreliable.  The emotional and interactive experience is poor and incentive mechanism is lacking. 2.2 User Research We collected 379 effective questionnaires and analyzed the answer, then interviewed 12 people for further understanding. The fillers’ age ranges from 27 to 53, with 28% male. The fillers are mostly from advanced cities in China such as Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Weihai or so. The result turns out to be:   Rewards and free-participation can improve the desire of participating an activity. Sponsors or being-welcomed can improve the desire of holding an activity.  The residents who might become our target users can be divided into 3 kinds. The possible activities can be divided into 6 kinds. User Experience Analysis According to the previous investigation, we used user journey, stakeholders map and other methods to analyzed the possible emotional design opportunities. The emotional low points would be turned into design opportunities and be considered in further design.  Based on the analysis, we defined the functions of the Neighbor-Reunion App. With the core functions of holding activities, participating activities, community moments. We also set up the design impression: United, Kind and Connected. Last but not the least, the design should:   consider stakeholders, including residents, residential property management company, community, surrounding stores,  create UGC platform to increase user stickiness,  include the incentive mechanism,  improve the experience of holding and participating activities.03 Design Output The design aims at answering 2 key problems:   How does Neighbor-Reunion help to build a community ecology?  How does Neighbor-Reunion attract residents to use?3.1 Function Structure With regard to key functions, I listed the functions structure and information that needs to be displayed.  3.2 Interaction Design  I designed the information structure and interaction for each function. After discussing with teammates and judges, we iterated our design for several times. Later, I assisted visual designer to deliver visual design.  3.3 Shiny and Innovative Points   AI empowers design          Adopted AI to use voice input for elder users to enter activity information. When users are setting up an activity, they can choose to use voice assistant. The App will ask user questions about the activity, so users just need to describe the activity to the App.      Adopted AI to recommend users and moments to neighbors.      Adopted AI to generate news about each activity. The material will be collected from user’s activity group chat as long as allowed. The news can help to increase the sense of participation.        Resource Integration empowers design          Use the idle resources like idle space from community and surrounding stores or cafes, exchanging for advertisement.      Satisfy the needs from residents, stores and community, trying to build a better atmosphere for sharing.      04 Conclusion It is a completed design process which I led. The design is not perfect and the solution may be not that feasible. And also, it is not and never will be developed. The pain point is the current situation of chinese community, but our solution is not integrated enough. To solve the problem better, an App is not enough and staying indoor and imaging is not enough. To better solve the related problems, we may go deeper into the real community and try to design from every perspective with more abundant forms. ","categories": [],

规划排期 - 申请通过 - 制作物料 - 投放申请 - 审批 - 上线 - 下线。因此，资源位和管理平台所需要考虑的主要就是，怎么样用最少的人力，把最关键的信息最好地触达用户。 在我实习的期间，我的抓手主要包括2部分：   资源位形式的创新，和对应使用流程的优化  管理平台的优化 行程中的弹窗是一个例子。一开始，弹窗仅支持弹出一张规规整整四四方方的图片。我的需求是将弹窗的形式尽可能的多样化，从而满足业务通过特殊形式吸引注意力的目的。于是我们让弹窗支持异形不规整的图片投放，还支持带透明度的H5投放。这样一来，运营的玩法就可以很多样了。 这个需求听起来并不复杂，但其实真的做起来涉及到很多具体的问题。举一个具体的例子，一位广告商想在我们的弹窗中投放一个广告，希望用户点击后跳转到他们的商品页。这个过程涉及到不懂技术的广告主爸爸，广告主的H5外包设计开发同学，我们的运营同学和资源投放平台。问题在于，广告主需要埋点监测点击，我们的运营同学也需要监测点击，但是这些点击的监测，需要在H5开发中调用我们乘客端提供的bridge能力才能实现。这样一来，沟通成本就大大提升了，因为前面提到的四个利益相关方中有1个是死的，2个不懂技术，唯一懂技术的只是一个外包。 产品经理思考的点在于，我怎么把产品提供的多样性的形式，和运营的沟通成本做权衡：太高的自由度必然带来太高的复杂性，那么，我们需要从产品能力上去限制自由度，提高沟通效率，以达到整体效益最大化的目标。 于是我限制了异形H5的透明底色，限制了H5仅能做一次点击，使得这次点击能够被监听到。这让运营同学的沟通成本降了下来，同时也保证了形式的丰富性和曝光量。这样的一个资源位，点击率、PV和商业化收入证明它还是有一定的业务价值的。  此外，我还做了一些优化工作台，提高人效的需求。这些需求并不依赖太多的同理心，也没有太高的难度。暂且按下不表。 整体来看，这部分的业务几乎是我独立负责的。虽然不难，但也让我很快熟悉了工作流程，掌握了一些沟通技巧和业务重点。  接下来是一个接近“失败”的产品，滴滴6.5大版本首页的信息流。目前只有在广州地区有部分流量还是这一版本，其他用户看到的应该都是橙心优选的商城或者所谓的Widget版本（后文会做解释）。 虽然只是打工人，但还是要去思考，为什么滴滴要做信息流？其实出发点很简单，也很模糊：滴滴作为工具型平台，希望提升自己的DAU，也就是提升用户粘性。怎样可以大幅度提升用户粘性？也许通过提供优质的内容，可以抢夺到一部分的用户注意力时间，从而带来增量收益。 要做一个信息流，涉及到很多产品和技术层面的问题。技术的复杂依赖关系暂不展开，从产品层面来看，要把信息流做出来，主要做两方面的事情：   丰富底料：有优质的内容才可能吸引到注意力  完善能力：不说超越，至少能力上要达到信息流的标准 把刚刚“为什么滴滴要做信息流”的问题拓展成关于业务和产品目标的问题：怎么让信息流内容带来增量收益？也可以换个说法，怎么让用户看我们的信息流？怎么让用户不打车的时候也看我们信息流？怎么让信息流为我们的业务带来转化？ 还没来得及太深入的思考，在从0到1的阶段，我们做的事基本上分成两部分： 丰富内容 内容的来源初定为3类：第三方内容源提供的资讯，地图部门和携程合作的poi内容（热门景点、餐厅、酒店等，类似大众点评）以及内部内容（滴滴内部的宣传物料，如品类介绍H5、优惠信息等）。 对于第三方提供的资讯，策略是选取与出行场景和生活场景相关的内容主题；对于地图poi内容，我们期待它能够缩短用户的转化链路。但问题是，当前的用户习惯是在产生出行需求后才会打开滴滴App，希望做到内容带动消费，可能需要用户心智的改变。此处的抓手尚不明确。此外，还包括内容出现时间的策略，比如行程中是不是一个更适合内容消费的场景，等等。 完善能力 从视觉样式、浏览体验、推荐策略、内容审核管理与配置、数据埋点与分析等方面，我们制定了信息流MVP版本所需要的能力，并推动上线。 PPT中从左到右，分别是 1.纯资讯内容，方形卡片样式；2.纯地图poi内容，3:4卡片样式；3.三类内容均有，样式适配了封面图。  然而，信息流最终并没有成为6.5大版本的首页选择。除去集团高优的橙心优选商城外，平台选用了PPT中右侧所示的Widget样式。做出这个决策的具体原因包括：   信息流的第三方资讯内容由于滴滴无法获得内容发布资质而无法上线  信息流并未在窗口期内证明它有显著的正向收益，而Widget版本能够为各业务带来更强的曝光，也有正向GMV收益但从执行者的角度去复盘，除了客观的资质问题外，还是能总结出产品方法上的问题：   信息流的开发和Native端耦合，每次需要进行样式或体验上的修正，都需要配合乘客端App发版。乘客端App发版的周期长，每个版本间相隔2周。这导致了MVP的迭代周期很慢，同时很多开发资源被集中去支持橙心优选。从我们10月中旬接手，到一个相对完整的信息流版本上线，已经是12月下旬的时候了。实际上，我们可以选用一种与Native端解耦的技术栈，但当时的决策者并未做出这样的决策。  没有想清楚信息流的竞争优势是什么。在做信息流的时候，我们应该更有压力，更多去思考和Widget版本或是和6.0版本相比，需要达到哪些先决条件，才能够引发正向的收益。这个问题至今我也没有一个明确的答案，有人说滴滴本来就不应该做信息流，也在某种程度上是正确的。截止1月中，仅在广州地区的5%流量，保有了带地图poi内容与不带地图poi内容的两类信息流以进行AB测试。很遗憾我与Mentor花费了较多精力的一个项目并没有成功，但试错也许是实习时比成功更好的收获。更令人惋惜的是我作为产品经理实习生，很大程度上并没有决策权，但这也是打工人的通病了。如何向上管理，又将成为另一个问题。  最后一个分享的项目，是接手市内拼车拼成乐模式（拼成出发一口价）的“畅拼卡”。这是一款很有趣的产品，我从背景开始介绍。 由来与现状 市内拼车业务在线上主要有两种产品形态：1.“打车”模块下的“两口价”模式，即在发快车单时选择接受拼车，拼成则低价；2.“青菜拼车”模块下的“拼成乐”模式。即发单后仅在拼成情况下才派车，一定享受低价。这两种产品形态的区别，可以抽象为出发时间确定性和价格确定性的互斥。 “畅拼卡”是一款针对“拼成乐”的产品。“拼成乐”在用户视角的问题是拼成率可能不高，出发时间确定性低，在通勤（约50%完单）场景下存在痛点，导致用户不愿等，不愿使用拼成乐；在业务视角的问题是拼成率、应答率这两个关键指标和整体规模缺乏有力的增长抓手。“畅拼卡”正是为了解决这个问题而生的产品。 “畅拼卡”是一款提供用户出发时间稳定性的产品。针对客均单价在某限制以下，拼成率在某限制以上的线路，售卖价格在9-15元。其权益是，当用户等候时间达到某时间点（如10分钟）时，即使没有拼到拼友，系统也会开始给用户派车，用户享受拼成的价格，路上会继续拼。换句话说，除非处于极端供需失衡场景（周围无可接驾车辆），否则用户等待10分钟必能出发。这样的权益降低了出发时间的不确定性。 从过去MVP实验和线上的情况来看，畅拼卡能够大幅度提高用户拼成乐使用频次（超100%），从而提高线路的应答率和拼成率。存在的问题包括：   客诉多：权益感知有误，排队分单逻辑有误  购卡引导、复购、生效等感知待优化  待制定长远的产品发展路径 我的工作 在明确问题和目标后，确定抓手达成目标。具体来说，我的工作包括：   够买引导的优化。基于一个已知的事实：点击进入详情页后的购买转化率高达50%，我们一方面尝试优化卡面传递的信息，如将关键信息提高信息层级（标签），提高用户点击率；另一方面，我们计划进行AB实验来测试价格的展示对点击率的影响是正向还是负向，来进一步迭代卡面的设计。  复购引导的优化。卡即将到期时，卡面的变化以及短信等其他触达方式的策略。  对排队分单等逻辑做梳理和校对，配合技术一起完善各种异常情况下的策略。比如解决了存在自动关单的Bug，在极端供需失衡情况下无法派车的信息透传等。  讨论和梳理了畅拼卡未来的规划。会在下文讨论。 讨论 畅拼卡的一组数据显示，畅拼卡的毛利是正的，也就意味着畅拼卡的存在无论在规模上还是在钱效上都是正的。“畅拼卡”利用了用户购买后的损失厌恶心理，大幅提高拼成乐使用次数，这是它对于业务最大的价值。而对于用户而言，未生效的情况下用户可以拼成发车，及时低价出行；生效的情况下也可以保证及时低价出行，看似是一个双赢的非零和博弈。 但实际上，我们不否认畅拼卡确实创造了用户价值（取决于用户价值如何定义）。但我理解畅拼卡可能会是一款用以改变用户心智或习惯的过渡型产品。 通过在中、高拼成率的线路上售卖畅拼卡，线路上的相关需求被强化，拼成乐规模上升，拼成率进一步上升，原本的中拼成率线路成为高拼成率线路。此时，有两种情况：   情况一：用户保持原有的拼成乐使用频率，线路维持高拼成率，此时其实已经不再需要畅拼卡这一产品，线路已经被转化为了高拼成线率，充分挖掘了线路潜力，需求也被固定。  情况二：用户在线路拼成率提升后发现畅拼卡逐渐不再生效（每次都有拼友），进而不再购买畅拼卡。但用户的拼成乐使用频率有一定的下降，线路无法始终维持高拼成率，此时又需要将这些用户转化为畅拼卡用户进而提频。这样的循环将会导致畅拼卡可能一直存在。这两种未来会属于哪种尚未有定论，也难下定论。当然，情况一肯定是更理想化的情况，情况二则会遇到再次转化用户的阻力。我们肯定期待并会努力让情况一发生，而这需要更具体抓手和执行。我很庆幸在实习期末尾遇到了这样一款产品，带来了一些有趣的思考。而畅拼卡这样的产品形态用于拼衡两种不确定性，在交易平台产品中也不多见，我觉得挺有意思。  除了业务上的实践外，在无数的会议和讨论学习中，还是对交易平台产品有一定的思考的。包括但不限于双边市场供需角度的分析框架，滴滴司乘匹配（分单）和转化漏斗的思考，规模、效率、体验、盈亏角度的指标体系，拼车这类复杂产品的心理学与经济学抽象等等，此处先按下不表，欢迎交流。   最后引用了王嘉陵《决策思维》中关于决策的一些道与术，确实在实践中有了更深的感触。只分享一点：关于决策的本质是分配资源达成目标这件事，除了在做产品上是这样，做任何事情都是这样。这段实习是我在同时上美国的网课期间完成的。我将自己的精力和时间资源中的60%分配给了实习，40%分配给了学业。我做出这样决策的原因是我认为这份实习经历可以让我在校招和后续的PM生涯中有更多的把握，我期待我的决策能够帮助我向我的目标迈进。 本文完。 ","categories": [],
