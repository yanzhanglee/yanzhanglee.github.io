        "excerpt":"Safe Office - An intelligent helper system to keep your office safe and your employees healthy. Brief   This article illustrates the design process and reflection on TECHIN 521 Design Thinking Studio at GIX. This is a 10-week project and we are group in 3. The project aims to practice our design thinking and methods to generate a solution to a design question related to COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19, the whole project is remotely done.  My role includes brainstorming, investigation, survey and data analysis, sketches, solution proposal, prototype making and presentation. As a design background student, I also share my much of my design experience and methods with my teammates. This article would be divided into 4 parts:   Problem Definition &amp; User Research  Solution Proposal  Solution Iteration  Takeaways 01 Problem Definition &amp; User Research   The input of this phase includes field investigation, survey and data analysis, secondary research, brainstomring, etc. Interview is not included. The outcome of this phase is a refined design question, a list of design insights and a list of prioritized user requirements. The overall design report can be referred here. 1.1 Initial Design Question &amp; Research The initial design question is:How can we facilitate employees who are working in the office to wear masks when it is necessary? To be specific, in China, most of the employees have come back to the office and began to work on-site for several months. People are becoming less vigilant to COVID and more and more people began to take their masks off in a relatively ‘safe’ place like their office. However, in-person communication without wearing a mask is still at high risk of infection. Thus, we are focusing on the employee’s perspective, trying to figure out how they use masks, why they wear or do not wear a mask, and what kind of design can we do to help them to keep safe in the workplace. The supporting evidence from secondary research includes:   People in China are becoming less vigilant to COVID. The Mask Use Rate dropped from over 72% (May, 2020) to 59% (Oct, 2020).  More than 90% of the companies were back to on-site working in March, 2020.  In-person communication is at high risk of infection.  Ventilation and mask use can greatly help to protect from COVID in the office environment.  About half of people think masks are uncomfortable to wear. Other reasons include hard to remember to re-wear masks, inefficient communication.1.2 Stakeholders &amp; Core Users  Our core users will be white-collars who have returned to the company and have been working on-site for months. They have stable daily routines and familiar working environments, which makes it easy for them to ignore the risk of being infected. Many of them have taken off masks during their work.To be specific, our target users would be employees who 1) do not wear masks during in-person communication and 2) would have in-person communication usually. 2 Key factors to group users:   The frequency of in-person communication is high or low. ‘High’ stands for more than 1 meeting/day, the portion is 20% (according to survey).  The reasons why they did not wear a mask during in-person communication. One reason is that they trust in people or colleagues so they think it is unnecessary. The other reason is that they think it is necessary to wear masks while they forget to wear/bring or it is uncomfortable or inefficient.The users are divided into 3 segments.   Target Segment 1: Employees who would have frequent in-person communication with other employees. According to the survey, around 20% of the samples would have more than 1 meeting/day.  Target Segment 2: Employees who do not wear masks because they think it is unnecessary.  Target Segment 3: Employees who do not wear masks because they forget to wear/bring the masks.1.3 Field Research &amp; Survey Data Analysis Through semi-structural field observation, taking notes, we proved the phenomena and generated a list of findings. Later, survey was conducted to learn more on the user behaviors and why they behave like this. We received 108 responses, and the valid number is 97 after filtering. 58 respondents consisted of our connections and their colleagues, the other 50 people were recruited from an online recruitment service. Comparison analysis, correlation analysis are included in survey data analysis. Interesting findings include:   55.7% of the samples believe that it is safe to talk with colleagues without a mask. 40.2% of samples think it is safe to talk face-to face without a mask. Trust affects employees’ not wearing masks during communication.  34% of the samples consider ‘forget to take on masks’ a reason for in-person communication without masks.  46.4% of samples think it is inconvenient and inefficient to communicate when wearing a mask.  When an employee takes COVID infection risk more seriously, he or she would probably wear a mask more usually when sitting in its own workplace, chatting and meeting with others.Please find more details in the report. 1.5 Insights &amp; Design Requirements Insights Affinity analysis is conducted during the discussion to generate insights. User Experience   Our target users (white-collar employees) are at a high level of risk of infection.  Chatting casually with colleagues is the most frequent in-person communication.  People expect that meetings should be efficient, not interrupted.  People caring about COVID infection risk more would probably wear a mask.  People may ignore some protective guidelines.Why user does not wear a mask   People may take off masks because of inconvenience and discomfort.  Forgetting to take on the mask is a reason for in-person communication without masks.  When chatting casually, people are not likely to wear masks due to trust in the environment and colleagues.  People may not wear a mask during meetings because it is not efficient.Prioritized Design Requirements   The solution should help reduce employees’ risk of being infected by COVID-19 when they are working on-site  The solution should promote an atmosphere and remind users to take measures to keep safe  The design must be compatible with the existing company system and policy  The solution must be affordable for the company  The design can only use existing materials and technologies that have been proved effective to prevent COVID infection  The solution should ensure face-to-face communication as well as efficiency in meetings and discussions  To achieve a relatively high use rate, the solution must encourage people to follow  The solution should apply to different casual chatting scenarios.  The solution should help users understand the potential risk of infection and their exposure level to potential viruses  The solution should relieve the discomfort of wearing a mask  The solution must be easy to use and not change the user’s daily routine dramatically  The solution should give users reminders in a calm manner and should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms  The solution should not be disturbing to use in meeting rooms  The solution should cater for different kinds of offices  The solution should make use of common facilities in the company to avoid extra purchasing expenditureAt the end of this phase, the design question is refiend to be:How can we remind and encourage employees to take measures to protect themselves from COVID-19 during in-person communications? 02 Solution Proposal   In this phase, based on what we got from previous analysis, we brainstormed and proposed design solution. We are required to think of the solution in a scenario - through sketches and discussion. The detail report can be referred here. 2.1 Scenarios Through sketches, we generated 3 scenarios where our solution could possibly involve. The main scenarios are: Office entrance / elevators, Meeting rooms, Cafeteria / vending machine.  2.2 Initial Solution To summarize, our initial solution is combined by 3 parts:   Face-mask identification or payment built on real-life terminals. By making a mask a part of identification or payment, mask will be too important to be forgotten.  Pop-up reminders based on your schedules or your behaviors  A reward credits system based on Hook Model to encourage users to earn credits and form habits. What is the Hook Model?It is how the solution educate and change user behaviors.  03 Solution Iteration   Through usability test on core tasks, we figured out what needs to be improved. The detailed report can be referred here. 3.1 Usability Test In this study, we presented prototypes of 4 digital interfaces created with Modao and an interactive website as a prototype of the terminal interface. The participants received a separate link for each task. One of the team members was the narrative and another one was the note taker.Each of the prototypes are interactive so team members did not need to operate them and users can explore on their own. Task descriptions and TODOs are presented by slides via Zoom. The testing process was recorded by Zoom. Link to the test introduction slides. Link to tasks   Task 1. The meeting reminder.  Task 2. The lunch reminder.  Task 3. Face-mask recognition module on cashier.  Task 4. The check-out reminder.  Task 5. The summary and reward system.According to the feedback from the usability test, we improved our design. 3.2 Final Solution The final solution is an integrated system, which includes front-end terminals and backend parts. The system is illustrated below. From user perspective, they would notice 2 kinds of things. First, a Mini Program or bot in their working IM Application. This us to send them reminder of related protective measures, and let user confirm their credits as well as rewards. Second, display screens in meeting rooms and payment/entry recognition machines would also be integrated into the system. They would be used to detect user whether they are wearing a mask or not. Based on the usability test, 2 main changes are:   A Leaderboard which encourages user to have good behavior and let other colleagues to check so as to reduce cheating.  More attractive rewards. 04 Takeaways Methods About Defining Question About Survey &amp; Data Analysis About Multidisciplinary Collaboration Thinking About Design Thinking Process What is a good design solution What can we improve next time ","categories": [],

        "title": "Web Design - Patent Novelty Website",
        "excerpt":"A website which could evaluate the potential value of a patent.一个可以衡量专利潜在价值的网站    The website is now available. View website    Code Resource  I did this design project during my outbound exchange period in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), with the guide of Prof.Luo Jianxi. Generally speaking, I redesigned the structure of the website as well as the visual part, and put the design into practice by building the website based on my design. Please forgive me for the low quality of some parts of the website, because of my naive design experience and poor deleloping skill. 这是我在新加坡科技设计大学（SUTD）交换时的科研项目，指导教授为Luo Jianxi教授。总体上看，我基于用户体验重新设计了网站的结构与视觉，并使用自己的前端开发技能付诸实践。该网站现已上线，可以在下方的链接中尝试使用或者是获得源码。必须承认，囿于开发水平和设计经验，网站中有太多不成熟和不够细致的地方，请见谅。 Schema 大纲 Understand the theory 理解原理Design 设计Develop 开发Improvement 用户调研、反馈与迭代Shortcoming &amp; Take Away 缺点与学习 Understand the theory 理解原理 这个网站旨在使用一种新型独特的测量方式来测量一个专利的潜在价值。这个测量方式是由SUTD-MIT国际设计中心（IDC）的Luo Jianxi教授与He Yuejun博士研究发现的，相关论文如下：   Yuejun He, Jianxi Luo (2017) The Novelty “Sweet Spot” of Invention. Design Science, 3, e21.  Yuejun He, Jianxi Luo (2018) Assess Novelty of An Invention Using the Central-Extreme Novelty Matrix: A Case Study of Juvo Lab’s Fibre-Optic Sensor Mat. ICDC, 2018, Bath, UK.专利刚被申请时，很难在短期内判断其商业价值，一般来说都需要10年以上的时间才能得到确认。研究发现的这种新型方法指出，使用文中所述的两个变量——专利新颖程度的“极值”与“中心值”——进行专利“坐标”的标定，专利价值的分布有规律可循，其中有价值专利密度最高的区域被称之为“Sweet Spot”。原始的网站如下图所示，图中的矩阵使用蓝色边框将“Sweet Spot”区域框出。用户输入专利的ID或者是关键词，再对对应的专利进行查询，它在矩阵中的位置会对应高亮。如果它位于蓝色区域中，那么它的潜在价值可能是较大的。 在阅读文献的过程中，我发现实际上论文中已经给出了一张完整的专利潜在价值分布图。所谓的“Sweet Spot”只是其中最集中的一块区域，但其周边的深色区域较浅色区域，专利的潜在价值依然较大。那么为什么不直接将专利的对应分布直接地告诉用户呢？否则，对用户来说，专利便只有“在区域内”和“在区域外”两种情况。经过和教授讨论，这样的方式是可行的。于是接着进入了设计阶段。 Design 设计 建立在对论文和评估方法有一定了解的基础上，我的设计步骤如下：   分析原网站用户交互流程  设计用户交互流程  设计网站框架  制作视觉稿Analyze Original Website 分析原网站用户交互流程 根据对原网站的体验，我将用户交互流程制作如下图：可以发现，用户在使用的过程中会产生诸如：什么是专利的新颖性？网站是怎么衡量它的？专利的ID是什么？专利的关键词是什么？等问题。 Design User Interaction 设计用户交互流程 该网站的本质是一个工具，其核心在于提供专利价值的衡量。对于一个工具，可以暂时简单地把用户分为小白用户(Naive User)与熟练用户(Skillful User)两类。针对熟练用户，网站需要做到快速响应，让用户的操作流畅而完整；针对小白用户，则需要首先解答“网站是做什么的？”这个问题，同时教育用户并建立信任感。对此，我计划使用一个Demo进行案例教学，并提供How it works这个部分进行评估原理的简单讲解。新的用户交互流程如下： Design Web Structure 设计网站框架 结合用户交互流程，网站框架如下：   Home 主页          Search Patent ID 搜索专利ID      Search Keywords 搜索关键词        Demo 案例          Select a Patent 选择专利      View Result 查看结果        How it works 原理  About 关于Visual Design 制作视觉稿 随后，我使用Ai制作了网页的视觉稿，并结合教授的意见进行了反复修改。在制作视觉稿的过程中，我结合自学的前端知识，尽量避免了“做不出来的设计”。（当然，更多是由于我自身技术能力的不足） Develop 开发 除去导航栏等小部件，我将需求分为了以下几个主要部分，并按顺序进行开发： Demo 当用户的Cookie判断为第一次浏览该页面时，进入Demo页面。Demo页面希望呈现出三个专利供用户选择。这三个专利需要满足一些条件，比如专利本身或者专利对应的产品要有足够的知名度，同时专利自身在测量矩阵上的分布要在高价值区域。希望通过这样的方式，让用户测试一个专利，并获取相应的信息，在教学的同时建立测量机制的可信度。在花费了大量的时间之后，我选择了比较合适的三个专利。对专利视觉信息的呈现也做了一定的组织安排。在实现方面，基本是通过css来实现的。为了让网页显得更加具有焦点和富有科技感，我引用了particle.js，在网页的背景制作了可与鼠标交互的粒子动效。选择其中一个专利进行测量之后，详情页面会介绍测量的结果。除去专利本身的信息外，也会呈现该专利与现实世界中具体产品应用的关系。通过这个页面，希望让用户明白网站中矩阵坐标、对应颜色与产品潜在价值的映射关系，同时建立对这样的评价体系的信任。 Home 主页提供输入专利ID或者关键词进行搜索的功能，显示界面应该包括左侧的矩阵位置和右侧的专利信息。在原版的基础上，我做了如下的优化：   将Keywords和ID的输入框进行微调  将原本不具有强度的矩阵转换为现在具有强度的矩阵，通过颜色表示价值高低  将专利信息的呈现进行调整 How it works How it works页面的本意是通过一个页面介绍论文中用于衡量专利价值的方法。由于对信息的理解和表达能力的限制，这个页面的完成度并不高，故在此处就不展示了，有兴趣可以前往http://www.innogps.com/innovelty/how_it_works.html 查看。 Improvement 用户调研、反馈与迭代 第一版的网站并非是如前文图示那样的。在信息呈现方式上与现在的版本有着较大的差距，遗憾的是我没有保存网页的前一版本。具体来说，做了如下的改变：   将原版本中的Demo中三个专利的布局和呈现方式做了改变  将Demo中专利详情页的布局和呈现做了改变  调整了Home中Keywords搜索的呈现方式这些改变是建立在我将网页发给2位设计专业的同学和2位外专业的朋友的反馈的基础上的，根据他们对网站意图和视觉呈现的评价，我做出了相应的改变。 Shortcoming &amp; Take Away 缺点与学习 最大的不足之一是由于自学前端经验不足，所有页面没有使用开发框架，所以没有做移动端适配，在小尺寸的屏幕上会出现形变。此外，由于前端实践的时间与精力需求对于我来说远高于设计的，在设计方面有很多细节没有做到位。相对的，第一次独立完成了网页的设计与开发，在很多细节上有了自己的认知与把控，并确立了继续学习React等开发框架的计划。 ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"It encourages users to share anything and let other users praise for it. 夸夸小程序是一个用户分享内容，其他用户只能发表夸赞评论的社区 Overview Brief Introduction Based on a culture phenomena (explained in 01 Background), me and 3 teammates tried to make it a product and make profits from it. We got involved in the culture phenomena, trying to control it and make it our promotion media in the future, which was quite successful. Also, we quickly designed and developed the Wechat Mini Program and successful made profits from it. Through this project, we successfully applied for a National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training For College Students. We finally gave up the program but learned a lot from the experience. But you can still try it by searching “夸夸” in Wechat. Highlights   The product design opportunity is quite different from usual products, it comes from a culture phenomena and we tried to make it a product.

Directed the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training For College Students, planned for more projects with teammates.Schema 01 Background02 Design Goals03 Design Challenges04 Develop Plan05 Design06 Launch and Iteration07 Conclusion 01 Background Wechat(微信): The biggest IM App in China. Wechat Mini Program: Apps which can be used within Wechat and do not need to be downloaded and installed on the system. Moment(朋友圈): A function of Wechat, where users share their thoughts by publishing photos or text. During the mid-Feb. in 2019, posts about ‘ZJU KuaKua Wechat group’ are filled with ZJUer’s moments. Those posts are all about the interesting conversation that happened in KuaKua Wechat group, which makes people laugh or feel inspired. ZJU KuaKua Wechat group originates from another group in Douban (a website and app community of sharing interests), the rule is that any member can share anything in the group especially the upset things, and other members can only comment or reply with praise. For example, when a user sent “I broke up today…”, the other users can comment like “OMG, you are free now! You deserve someone better and surely you can find a true love. Sounds great!” Because of the funny and inspiring conversation, the Wechat KuaKua group soon became very popular and the groups are more and more. Within 3 days, there are more than 1500 people in the KuaKua Wechat Group in ZJU, and other universities are building up the groups as well. Our team got involved in the first KuaKua group when it set up. After experienced the rule, we considered it a workable concept which can be transferred into a product. Mini Program has 2 advantages comparing to Wechat groups, including a wider range community and less operation consumption. Thus, we tried to develop the KuaKua Wechat Mini Program. 02 Design Goals Firstly, we analyzed the product goals:   To accumulate users, increase DAU.  To encourage users to spread and share the Mini Program.  To make profits through ad or paid service.Then, we clarify the design goals:   To let users easily use the Mini Program and have a better experience than Wechat groups.  To make users share or spread the Mini Program to increase DAU.03 Design Challenges To be specific and based on the team capability, I clarify the design challenges:   A warm and welcomed interface which creates the atmosphere of praise and inspiration.  A friendly interaction which encourages users to publish posts and comments, and to let users stay.  A completed user interaction of publishing posts, comment, deletion, reward, setting or so.  A feedback collection to future functions.

Based on the feedback, we changed our design and develop direction. 05 Design I delivered the first version of UI in 3 days, constructing the basic functions. I would show the user-flow and demonstrate design details. Adopted the most similar way to publish posts as in a Wechat group. Users can finish all the operation at the bottom of the phone.Users can use ‘red envelope’ to reward users who comment him or her with praise. This model is similar to the Red Envelope function in Wechat, so it would be easy for users to learn. Users can also praise other’s posts. Meanwhile, your posts may be rewarded by others as long as it is interesting or inspiring. Other unimportant pages are not shown. I deliver about 30 interfaces to develop in 3 days. Waiting for the data to make iteration. 06 Launch and Iteration After developed the Mini Program, we send it to several KuaKua Wechat group to collect feedback and data.We monitored the users’ behavior and tried to figure out how to improve the Mini Program. We also collected feedback from advanced users. From the data we learned that, users are not likely to share their posts directly in their moments. And even we did not do any promotion, users are growing but hard to reserve. We did several improvement and fix several bugs. More importantly, we adopted chat-bot to Mini Program, so user’s posts will always have comments. The bot is not that intelligent but it is working. Besides, we thought the current Mini Program is like a forum, where everything goes really slow. Users did not have the feeling that the comments and praise will be as fast as they are in a Wechat group. Even though users can view more various posts and praise, they still want the instant message feeling. Therefore, we decided to make a revolutionary improvement.The new Mini Program will be like chatting rooms, just like Wechat groups. But the chatting rooms will be created and destroyed shortly, making the comments rapid and interesting. The new version is shown below. But due to limited effort, we did not develop this version. 07 Conclusion Comparing to ordinary App project, this project is different because:   It is designed for build and launch.  Gain profits from it.It still exists user needs and design definition progress, but it needs a really fast developing since we need to catch the hot spot. It is my first time really design for build and launch. What’s more, we did earn money from building the App, even it is not too much, but at least it means some one appreciates our work.

        "excerpt":"an App and service design to improve micro-district community atmosphere. 有缘共邻里，何不来相聚   如果你使用的是MacOS，可以直接下载可交互原型进行体验. Overview Brief Introduction 邻聚(Lin-ju),邻 stands for neighbors and 聚 stands for reunion, so name it Neighbor-Reunion in English. This design comes from the User Experience Design Award, where we did users and business research, brainstorm, interaction design, visual design, shooting and making videos to deliver our ideas. From the preliminary\tcontest, intermediary contest and final contest, we finally won the National 3rd Prize, ranking top 20 out of 500+ teams. Based on our research, we try to use design to improve the community atmosphere, encouraging tenements to communicate and making the best use of resources from tenements, residential property management company and surrounding stores. Highlights   A very completed research and design process.  Interesting new experience and interaction by adopting advanced technology.Information Mar. 2019 - Jul. 2019 | 4 months | 7 people My Role   As team leader, schedule and manage the design process, including meetings, allocating work, making decisions or so.  As User Experience Designer, offered valuable suggestions and ideas to functions and interactions. Delivered more than 50 interaction interfaces.Schema 01 Background   User perspective: In modern cities, residents live in micro-districts or communities, spending their nights and weekends at their house. However, there are reports pointing out that neighbors are being more and more unfamiliar with each other. Residents tend to stay in their houses, but many of them actually have a desire to make friends. Also, new members of the community need opportunities to fit in. Meanwhile, there are activities in communities or micro-districts, but the types are limited and management is terrible.  Technical perspective: Existing products has experience problems, since they do not connect well with the residential property management company and do not well-operated. Since residents live in a community, they must have something in common like salary, taste or work. With those similarity, it would be easier for them to make friends.  Market perspective: There are idle resources around the community, like community space or surrounding cafe, stores. Those resources can be used better.02 Research 2.1 Competing Products Analysis We collected more than 10 related Apps on App Store, analyzed them from many dimensions. The result is:   Those Apps are lack of cooperation with stakeholders, functions are single or unreliable.  The emotional and interactive experience is poor and incentive mechanism is lacking. 2.2 User Research We collected 379 effective questionnaires and analyzed the answer, then interviewed 12 people for further understanding. The fillers’ age ranges from 27 to 53, with 28% male. The fillers are mostly from advanced cities in China such as Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Weihai or so. The result turns out to be:   Rewards and free-participation can improve the desire of participating an activity. Sponsors or being-welcomed can improve the desire of holding an activity.  The residents who might become our target users can be divided into 3 kinds. The possible activities can be divided into 6 kinds. User Experience Analysis According to the previous investigation, we used user journey, stakeholders map and other methods to analyzed the possible emotional design opportunities. The emotional low points would be turned into design opportunities and be considered in further design.  Based on the analysis, we defined the functions of the Neighbor-Reunion App. With the core functions of holding activities, participating activities, community moments. We also set up the design impression: United, Kind and Connected. Last but not the least, the design should:   consider stakeholders, including residents, residential property management company, community, surrounding stores,  create UGC platform to increase user stickiness,  include the incentive mechanism,  improve the experience of holding and participating activities.03 Design Output The design aims at answering 2 key problems:   How does Neighbor-Reunion help to build a community ecology?  How does Neighbor-Reunion attract residents to use?3.1 Function Structure With regard to key functions, I listed the functions structure and information that needs to be displayed.  3.2 Interaction Design  I designed the information structure and interaction for each function. After discussing with teammates and judges, we iterated our design for several times. Later, I assisted visual designer to deliver visual design.  3.3 Shiny and Innovative Points   AI empowers design          Adopted AI to use voice input for elder users to enter activity information. When users are setting up an activity, they can choose to use voice assistant. The App will ask user questions about the activity, so users just need to describe the activity to the App.      Adopted AI to recommend users and moments to neighbors.      Adopted AI to generate news about each activity. The material will be collected from user’s activity group chat as long as allowed. The news can help to increase the sense of participation.        Resource Integration empowers design          Use the idle resources like idle space from community and surrounding stores or cafes, exchanging for advertisement.      Satisfy the needs from residents, stores and community, trying to build a better atmosphere for sharing.      04 Conclusion It is a completed design process which I led. The design is not perfect and the solution may be not that feasible. And also, it is not and never will be developed. The pain point is the current situation of chinese community, but our solution is not integrated enough. To solve the problem better, an App is not enough and staying indoor and imaging is not enough. To better solve the related problems, we may go deeper into the real community and try to design from every perspective with more abundant forms. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Chinese Rate-My-Professor and even better. 高校教师与课程评价交流平台  概览 项目简介 在浙江大学，一款名为“查老师”的网页允许同学们匿名评价老师（打分、写评价），是同学们选课、上课必备的产品，也是我们团队成员使用了2年的产品。但在当前的环境下，它遇到了几个问题：   开发者已毕业，产品运营能力有限，网站因未备案下线  产品形态为网页，使用不便，延伸性有限  产品结构单一，仅有匿名教师评价功能，需求满足有限于是，我所在的国家级大学生创新创业训练项目组决定以全新的产品形态和结构去承载相关的需求，由此诞生了「课否」平台。  亮点 「课否」的亮点与创新点主要有：   如何走出“查老师”的阴影，展现产品形象与品牌特色  整理与判断同学们的相关需求，进行功能规划和设计  结合数据进行分析与迭代数据表现：   踩准选课节点，上线2周时累计用户超过10,000名，最高单日页面访问量超200,000人次  至2020-01，累计用户超过14,000名，用户次日留存率和7日留存率在20%左右浮动，日活与学校行为有关，呈周期性变化   我的工作 我是国创项目的立项人，作为产品设计师，主要负责：   挖掘需求，收集反馈，框定功能细节，结合开发和设计排期进行功能规划，结合数据进行反馈  进行交互与界面设计，输出交互与视觉设计稿进行开发  进行运营推广，运营与配置公众号，撰写、制作推文 01 产品规划 在思考如何与“查老师”平台做出差异化的过程中，我们是这样思考的。 《产品方法论》中提到，我们把用户视为一个需求的集合，去思考有哪些未被满足的需求。而“查老师”平台主要满足了用户如下3方面的需求：   选好课。在平台上查找老师，查看评价，以决定是否选择该老师的课程。  分享感受。通过评价老师来分享自己对老师的感受，并为其他同学提供有价值的内容。  发泄情绪。通过评价老师来发泄自己的愤怒、不甘或是厌恶等情绪对于“选好课”的需求，其本质是“好好学习”的需求，涉及到“选课”、“上课”、“考试”等等环节，目的就是学到知识或拿到高分。 对此，显然我们可以给出很多差异化的角度：   “评价”这一行为可以从教师延伸至课程，而针对“课程”，图文资料、心得感受等等内容的分享将会更加多元化，也更有价值  涉及到“成绩”部分，我们也可以提供相关的分析工具，来满足学生分析自我成绩，推测排名，以及计算绩点排名等需要  评价内容的获取，可以由用户主动搜索过度至我们的推荐，内容获取的方式有很大设计空间建立在上述基础上，我们将课否产品结构建立如下： 具体的PRD不进行展示。  02 产品设计 2.1 设计背景 建立在基本明确产品框架的和功能规划的前提下，我需要尽快产出设计以快速上线迭代。 第一期（2019-09 ~ 2019-10）的交互与视觉设计主要包括：   搜索页面，教师与课程列表页、详情页的设计  教师与课程评价流程和相关页面的设计  首页样式、榜单样式的设计  “我的”个人页面的设计第二期（2019-12 ~ 2020-01）的交互与视觉设计主要包括：   学生身份认证流程和相关页面的设计  评价资格考试流程和相关页面的设计  成绩模块，认证流程和相关分析的设计2.2 设计目标   快速（每期1-2周时间）输出流程正确、交互合理、信息呈现清晰的小程序界面  对部分功能进行测试与反馈，迭代设计2.3 设计过程中遇到的挑战 1.较复杂信息的呈现 在教师与课程列表页、教师与课程详情页、成绩页都遇到了类似的问题。 解决流程为：   使用脑图梳理信息全集，按重要性进行分级  信息分完全现实、缩略显示、不显示三级  对信息进行排布尝试，借鉴类似信息流App进行设计 2.课程评价与教师评价的解耦 课程评价和教师评价原本是结合在一起，互相挂钩的，也就是如果评价老师时勾选了对应课程，在课程页会显示，反之亦然。为什么分开呢？ 主要原因是我们认为对教师和对课程的评价的内核是不同的，其中对教师的评价是个人为导向的，分享的内容和老师上课的方式以及老师本人有关，而与课程不一定完全挂钩。再之，也可以通过在评价内容中提及的方式表达。而对课程的评价，我们希望课否平台后期可以更大程度上帮助同学们选课、上课、考试，因此会鼓励多元化的图文资料等内容的分享，与老师评价的性质是不一致的。 3.如何建立良好的社区氛围 主要通过评价资格考试来规范用户的评价，也完善了“举报”机制和“新增审核”机制。       评价资格考试         “新增审核”机制    03 发布与迭代 3.1 埋点与数据收集 使用阿拉丁小程序数据分析工具进行埋点和数据收集。内容待整理。 3.2 一次危机 2020年1月3日，作为负责人的我接学校相关老师电话，在电话中对方表达了如下意思：   “课否”平台中，教师评价模块中，存在对老师进行个人人身攻击、恶意中伤、诽谤等的评价内容  “课否”平台中使用了部分来自于“查老师”平台数据库的数据，“查老师”的数据来源疑似使用爬虫  “课否”平台目前对所有人开放，并未限制用户身份，可能造成更大范围的不良影响  有老师考虑对课否相关负责人进行司法起诉对此，我们的具体应对措施包括：   分析情况是否属实，并就司法起诉相关事宜进行咨询  从明日起将“教师评价”的评论全部隐藏，显示“我们正在对评论进行审核与整理”，直到下文“学生身份验证”与“评价资格考试”功能上线  上线评价资格考试：所有学生用户必须经过10-20道问答题考试后才可以拥有评价权限，考试将主要围绕“正确的评价方式”进行  进行人工筛选：我们将组织成员定期对低分评价进行人工审核  完善举报机制：允许其他用户举报恶意评论，并给予奖励过多的内容不进行展示，相关功能已开发完毕，内测中遇到了用户很多的反馈意见，目前正在协商中。  04 总结 课否仍是一个在不断发展完善的产品，它将收到用户和校方双方的监督与反馈，在权衡下变得更好。这是我第一次接到夸张到“律师函警告”的投诉建议，也是我第一次面对数百位用户的反馈意见，并将其转化为产品功能与设计要素。时间有限，暂且总结到这里，改日再来补充。 在下一个版本，我们将会着重解决两方面问题：   用户隐私的保护与社区型产品的UGC鼓励机制  课程评价方面的优化","categories": [],
